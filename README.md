# Readme

HitchTracker is a taxi route management application that allows you to plan your taxi routes and view real-time statistics.
On startup, you should head to the Trip Tracker page to find our form. Here, you can enter your current location and destination to get detailed statistics for your preferred route.

If this application receives another development sprint, we would like to add a route planning feature that allows you to plan your trips more effectively by comparing different taxi services and finding the one that best suits your needs.
